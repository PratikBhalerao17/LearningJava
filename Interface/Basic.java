An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures,
default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. The methods in interfaces

implemented by the classes.

All methods are abstract
All fields are public static final

Interface can't have constructor
Can have default and static methods which has implementation


Java 9 introduced private methods in interfaces, which can help in accessing or modifying static fields.
Hereâ€™s an example using a static field with static methods:
